# Demo Parsing 

In this repository I will lay out all of the information needed to create your own demo parser targeting valve games.

While it might seem that just using another parser someone has made is the easiest solution, by creating your own parser you will not only create a better understanding of how to use these parsers, you will also gain a lot of programming skills and knowledge that will be useful in other domains as well.

This is still a WIP, and as time permits and knowledge becomes known, more information will be added.
